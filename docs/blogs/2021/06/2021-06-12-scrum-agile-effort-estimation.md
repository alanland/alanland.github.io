## Planning Poker

**In print Planning meetings**, everyone has to agree on the number chosen.

each individual has a deck of cards with numbers from the Fibonacci sequence on them

- e.g., 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on.

## Dot Voting
In Dot Voting, each team member starts with small dot stickers,
color-coded by the estimated effort required (e.g., S=green, M=blue, L=orange, XL=red).
