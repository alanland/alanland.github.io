## UX (User Experience) / UI (User Interface)

国外一篇文章介绍了两者的区别。

- 用户体验设计: UX Design / User Experience Design
- 用户体验设计师: UX Designer / User Experience Designer

有两个比喻来说明：

> “UI is the saddle, the stirrups, and the reins. UX is the feeling you get being able to ride the horse.”

— Dain Miller, Web Developer

> “User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) are some of the most confused and misused terms in our field. A UI without UX is like a painter slapping paint onto a canvas without thought; while UX without UI is like the frame of a sculpture with no paper mache on it. A great product experience starts with UX followed by UI. Both are essential for the product’s success.”

- Rahul Varshney, co-creator of Foster.fm

## UED (User Experience Design Department)

据说这个称呼起源于Yahoo的用户体验部门，后来被阿里传播开来。

## UCD (User Centered Design)

以用户为中心的设计。

## UGD（User Growth Design）

用户增长设计。

## IxD (Interaction Design)

交互设计
