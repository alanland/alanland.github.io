RQ (Redis Queue) is a simple Python library for queueing jobs and processing them in the background with workers. It is backed by Redis and it is designed to have a low barrier to entry. It can be integrated in your web stack easily.

## 安装
```shell
# source activate venv
pip install rq
```

## 启动Redis

## 编写程序

定义一个任务函数:
```python
import requests

def count_words_at_url(url):
    resp = requests.get(url)
    return len(resp.text.split())
```

创建RQ列队:
```python
from redis import Redis
from rq import Queue

q = Queue(connection=Redis())
```

排队我们的任务函数:
```python
from my_module import count_words_at_url
result = q.enqueue(
             count_words_at_url, 'http://nvie.com')
```
